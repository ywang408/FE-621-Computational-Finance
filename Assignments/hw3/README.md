Note:

- In problem 1, after finishing the function of explicit/implicit/Crank-Nicolson method, for part f, IF asks you to record the number of iterations. So we need to do some change on previous functions. Instead of doing that, it's better to design a class to solve initially and use inheritance of the class so as to solve part f. It would be much more convenient and don't have to do changes on previous codes.
